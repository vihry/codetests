# Code test

This test is about checking your eye for design, and general front end skills such as HTML & CSS

## Introduction

As front end developers, we may be handed a design to implement pixel for pixel. This task is similar to that, the goal is to achieve the exact same look & feel as the GIF included.

## Getting started

You will need a:

* Text editor, e.g. Visual Studio Code

1. Find design.gif committed under assignment_two/design.gif

Note that the design is an animated gif and contains some subtle animations & hover effects as well. 

## Your task

Your task is to reproduce the design with standard HTML & CSS. Feel free to use any library that you are used to, such as React, Vue, SASS, LESS etc, but if it requires install steps remember to deliver everything needed to be able to run it locally for verification in a zip file or pushed to a github repo. 

It is not wrong or right to use libraries - a standard HTML file with inline CSS is accepted as well, the main goal of this task is getting a sense for CSS skills & your eye for design.

Note that the switch to the right does not need to be functional on a javascript level, but feel free to use logic as necessary.

It is expected to use  ~1 to ~2 hours on this task.
